Ideas:
    Add a sign selection thing. So you can select multiple signs to edit at once.
        /toggleMultiSignEdit # Keeps all the signs selected stored even if you toggle it off.
        /clearSelectedSigns # Clears the stored array of signs selected.

        Right clicking a sign can toggle it from selection.

        Most commands would work the same except for:
        Copy/Cut: These would just copy/cut from the active sign

        In order for this to work you need to create functions for each command so that you can loop over the selected signs and execute the functions.
        You should also try to improve the design somehow.

TODO:
    Add more permissions (One for every command)
        At least add a permission for sign teleporting.

Issues:
    An issue can arise if your active sign gets destroyed and you try to edit it. Currently it doesn't give an error but the console will tell you something.
