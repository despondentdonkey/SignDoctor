Ideas:
    Add a sign selection thing. So you can select multiple signs to edit at once.
    
TODO:
    Add red brackets that surround the Sign Editor text that appears after every command. (aesthetic)

Issues:
    Make sure to handle input with 'editSignln' correctly. If you pass a string as the first argument you get an error.
    
    Handle errors if there is no input on all commands.
