Ideas:
    Add a sign selection thing. So you can select multiple signs to edit at once.
    
    Add config yml/txt file that allows you to configure the plugin:
        Enable editing by default
        Only allow right click selecting
        
    Namespace all commands by adding a prefix e.g. /signedit enable or /signedit switchln
    
TODO:
    Add permissions

Issues:
    Make sure to handle input with 'editSignln' correctly. If you pass a string as the first argument you get an error.
    
    Handle errors if there is no input on all commands.
    
    An issue can arise if your active sign gets destroyed and you try to edit it. Currently it doesn't give an error but the console will tell you something.
