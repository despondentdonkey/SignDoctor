Ideas:
    Add a sign selection thing. So you can select multiple signs to edit at once.
        /toggleMultiSignEdit # Keeps all the signs selected stored even if you toggle it off.
        /clearSelectedSigns # Clears the stored array of signs selected.
        
        Right clicking a sign can toggle it from selection.
        
        Most commands would work the same except for:
        Copy/Cut: These would just copy/cut from the active sign
        
        In order for this to work you need to create functions for each command so that you can loop over the selected signs and execute the functions. 
        You should also try to improve the design somehow.
        
    Add an append thing so you can just add onto a line. Would also work nicely with the multi-sign selection thing.
    
TODO:
    Add more permissions (One for every command)
    
    Make command functions throw exceptions rather than trying to say the messages. So we need an exception handler class that can handle stuff like INVALID_LINE_NUM.

Issues:
    An issue can arise if your active sign gets destroyed and you try to edit it. Currently it doesn't give an error but the console will tell you something.
