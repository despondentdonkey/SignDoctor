Ideas:
    Add a sign selection thing. So you can select multiple signs to edit at once.
    
    Add an append thing so you can just add onto a line. Would also work nicely with the multi-sign selection thing.
    
TODO:
    Add more permissions (One for every command)

Issues:
    An issue can arise if your active sign gets destroyed and you try to edit it. Currently it doesn't give an error but the console will tell you something.
